!Series_summary	"Aging is the strongest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The chromatin state, in particular through the mark H4K16ac, has been implicated in aging and thus may play a pivotal role in age-associated neurodegeneration. Here we compared the genome-wide enrichment of H4K16ac in the lateral temporal lobe of AD individuals against both younger and elderly cognitively normal controls. We find that while normal aging leads to H4K16ac enrichment, AD entails dramatic losses of H4K16ac in the proximity of genes linked to aging and AD. Our analysis highlights the presence of three classes of AD-related changes having distinctive functional roles. Furthermore, we discover an association between the genomic locations of significant H4K16ac changes with genetic variants (SNPs) identified in prior AD genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). Our results establish the basis for an epigenetic link between aging and AD."

The RNA fragments were then size-selected to 60-250 bp on a 15% TBE-urea gel. Illumina v1.5 RNA adapters were ligated to the 3’ and 5’ ends of the fragmented products using T4 RNA ligase 2, truncated (NEB) and T4 RNA ligase (Promega), respectively. cDNA libraries were generated using Superscript II (Invitrogen) and PCR-amplified using Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB). Libraries were purified on a 6% TBE gel (Invitrogen), treated with DSN and PCR re-amplified. Quality of the resulting sequencing libraries were verified by cloning into Zero Blunt TOPO (Invitrogen) and analyzing 6-10 clones by standard Sanger sequencing to determine the presence of adapters, appropriate size selection, abundance of ribosomal RNA, and the diversity of the library products.

Illumina v1.5 RNA adapters were ligated to the 3’ and 5’ ends of the fragmented products using T4 RNA ligase 2, truncated (NEB) and T4 RNA ligase (Promega), respectively. cDNA libraries were generated using Superscript II (Invitrogen) and PCR-amplified using Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB). Libraries were purified on a 6% TBE gel (Invitrogen), treated with DSN and PCR re-amplified. Quality of the resulting sequencing libraries were verified by cloning into Zero Blunt TOPO (Invitrogen) and analyzing 6-10 clones by standard Sanger sequencing to determine the presence of adapters, appropriate size selection, abundance of ribosomal RNA, and the diversity of the library products.

Libraries were purified on a 6% TBE gel (Invitrogen), treated with DSN and PCR re-amplified. Quality of the resulting sequencing libraries were verified by cloning into Zero Blunt TOPO (Invitrogen) and analyzing 6-10 clones by standard Sanger sequencing to determine the presence of adapters, appropriate size selection, abundance of ribosomal RNA, and the diversity of the library products. The libraries were pooled and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 using the standard protocols for 75 bp single-read sequencing."	"RNA sequencing libraries were prepared as previously described with a few changes, such as omission of the polyA+ selection step and addition of a double-stranded nuclease (DSN)-mediated step to deplete highly abundant RNA species, such as ribosomal RNA. Briefly, purified RNA was fragmented using RNA Fragmentation Reagent (Thermo Fisher) for 5 min at 70°C and followed by addition of a 5’ phosphate by treating with T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB). The RNA fragments were then size-selected to 60-250 bp on a 15% TBE-urea gel. Illumina v1.5 RNA adapters were ligated to the 3’ and 5’ ends of the fragmented products using T4 RNA ligase 2, truncated (NEB) and T4 RNA ligase (Promega), respectively. cDNA libraries were generated using Superscript II (Invitrogen) and PCR-amplified using Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB). Libraries were purified on a 6% TBE gel (Invitrogen), treated with DSN and PCR re-amplified. Quality of the resulting sequencing libraries were verified by cloning into Zero Blunt TOPO (Invitrogen) and analyzing 6-10 clones by standard Sanger sequencing to determine the presence of adapters, appropriate size selection, abundance of ribosomal RNA, and the diversity of the library products. The libraries were pooled and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 using the standard protocols for 75 bp single-read sequencing."
