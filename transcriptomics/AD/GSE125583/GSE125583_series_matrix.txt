!Series_summary	""
!Series_summary	"89 of the 289 subjects in this study were previously analyzed in GSE95587. For these subjects, the RNA was extracted from fusiform gyrus tissue blocks distinct to those used in GSE95587. The subjects, and the corresponding identifiers in GSE95587, are indicated in the descriptions as ""repeated in GSE95587: NA"" (for a new subject) or, for example, ""repeated in GSE95587: GSM2516875"" (for re-analyzed subject)."
