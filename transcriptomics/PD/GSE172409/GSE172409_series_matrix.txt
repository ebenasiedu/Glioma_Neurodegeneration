!Series_summary	"Background: Three-dimensional (3D) in vitro culture systems using human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) represent impactful platforms to model neurodegenerative disease biology in physiologically relevant microenvironments. Though many successful biomaterials-based 3D model systems have been established for other neurogenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s Disease, relatively few exist for Parkinson’s Disease (PD) research."
!Series_summary	"Methods: We employed tissue engineering approaches to construct a 3D silk scaffold-based platform for the culture of hiPSC-dopaminergic (DA) neurons derived from healthy individuals and PD patients harboring LRRK2 G2019S or GBA N370S mutations. We then compared results from protein, gene expression and metabolic analyses obtained from two-dimensional (2D) and 3D culture systems."
!Series_summary	"Results: The 3D platform enabled the formation of dense dopamine neuronal network architectures and developed biological profiles both similar and distinct from 2D culture systems in healthy and PD disease lines. 3D PD cultures showed elevated levels of α-synuclein and alterations in purine metabolite profiles. Furthermore, computational network analysis of transcriptome networks nominated several novel molecular interactions occurring in neurons from patients with mutations in LRRK2 and GBA."
!Series_summary	"Conclusion: The brain-like 3D system presented here is a realistic platform to interrogate molecular mechanisms underlying PD biology. The key advantages of silk-based bioengineering technology include long-term culture and the ability to incorporate multiple brain-relevant cell types to parse cell-cell interactions in development, disease, and aging."

Briefly, mRNA was purified from total RNA using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads. Fragmentation was carried out using divalent cations under elevated temperature in NEBNext First Strand Synthesis Reaction Buffer (5X). First strand complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using random hexamer primer and M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (RNase H-). Second strand cDNA synthesis was subsequently performed using DNA Polymerase I and RNase H. Remaining overhangs were converted into blunt ends via exonuclease/polymerase activities. After adenylation of 3’ ends of DNA fragments, NEBNext Adaptors with a hairpin loop structure were ligated to prepare for hybridization. To select cDNA fragments of 150~200 bp in length, the library fragments were purified with AMPure XP system (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). Then 3 μL USER Enzyme (New England Biolabs) was used with size-selected, adaptor-ligated cDNA at 37 °C for 15 minutes followed by 5 minutes at 95 °C before PCR. Then PCR was performed with Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase, Universal PCR primers and Index (X) Primer. At last, PCR products were purified (AMPure XP system, Beckman Coulter) and library quality was assessed on the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system.

Second strand cDNA synthesis was subsequently performed using DNA Polymerase I and RNase H. Remaining overhangs were converted into blunt ends via exonuclease/polymerase activities. After adenylation of 3’ ends of DNA fragments, NEBNext Adaptors with a hairpin loop structure were ligated to prepare for hybridization. To select cDNA fragments of 150~200 bp in length, the library fragments were purified with AMPure XP system (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). Then 3 μL USER Enzyme (New England Biolabs) was used with size-selected, adaptor-ligated cDNA at 37 °C for 15 minutes followed by 5 minutes at 95 °C before PCR. Then PCR was performed with Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase, Universal PCR primers and Index (X) Primer. At last, PCR products were purified (AMPure XP system, Beckman Coulter) and library quality was assessed on the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system. The clustering of the index-coded samples was performed on an Illumina Novaseq sequencer according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After cluster generation, the libraries were sequenced on the same machine and paired-end reads were generated at a read depth of 20 million reads."	"Library preparation was achieved using the NEBNext Ultra RNA library prep kit for Illumina systems following manufacturer’s recommendations (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) and index codes were added to attribute sequences to each sample. Briefly, mRNA was purified from total RNA using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads. Fragmentation was carried out using divalent cations under elevated temperature in NEBNext First Strand Synthesis Reaction Buffer (5X). First strand complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using random hexamer primer and M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (RNase H-).
